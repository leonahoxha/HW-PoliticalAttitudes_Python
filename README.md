# Political Attitudes

## Overview

This project analyzes political attitudes among German citizens using the European Social Survey (ESS) data from 2020. The analysis focuses on several key questions regarding political opinions, including attitudes towards income equality, immigration, and climate change. The project employs various statistical techniques to explore correlations and identify key predictors of political behavior.

The analysis was performed using **Python** with visualizations and data manipulation handled via common Python libraries.

## Data Sources

The following dataset was used:

1. **European Social Survey (ESS):** A comprehensive dataset that tracks the behaviors, attitudes, and beliefs of individuals across European countries, focusing on the 2020 wave.

## Key Sections

### 1. Data Exploration

- **Characterizing Voters:** Analyzes demographic factors and their relationship with political attitudes.
- **Visualization of Variables:** Explores two key variables through scatterplots and heatmaps, providing insights into their interdependencies.

### 2. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

- Conducts a PCA to identify underlying patterns in political attitudes, simplifying the complexity of the data while retaining essential information.

### 3. Logistic Regression

- **Model Building:** Utilizes logistic regression to understand the impact of various predictors on political party preference.
- **Prediction and Decision-Making:** Examines how well the model predicts voting behavior based on demographic and political attitude data.

## Key Findings

- Significant correlations were found between political attitudes towards immigration and income equality.
- PCA revealed distinct groupings of attitudes that can inform political strategy.
- Logistic regression highlighted demographic factors as key predictors of party preference among German citizens.
